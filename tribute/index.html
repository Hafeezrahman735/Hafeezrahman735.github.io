      <p id="tribute-info">Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, and died on April 4, 1968. His grandfather started the family's lengthy career as pastors of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, serving from 1914 until 1931; his father has served since then, and Martin Luther served as co-pastor from 1960 until his death. Along with his older sister Christine and younger brother Alfred Daniel Williams, he grew up in the city’s Sweet Auburn neighborhood, then home to some of the most prominent and prosperous African Americans in the country. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen and earning a B. A. from Morehouse College in Atlanta, where both his father and grandfather had graduated. In 1951, he received his B.D. after three years of theology study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, where he was elected president of a largely white senior class. He engaged in graduate studies at Boston University after winning a fellowship at Crozer, completing his residency for the PhD in 1953 and getting the degree in 1955. </p>
      <p id="tribute-info">He met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman with exceptional intellectual and creative abilities, in Boston. The family was blessed with two sons and two daughters. Although he had not intended to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the ministry, he changed his mind under the mentorship of Morehouse’s president, Dr. Benjamin Mays, an influential theologian and outspoken advocate for racial equality. Martin Luther King was called to be the pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1954. King was a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's leading organization of its sort at the time, and had always been a passionate advocate for civil rights for members of his race. </p>
      <p id="tribute-info">Early in December 1955, he was ready to accept the leadership of the first large nonviolent Negro demonstration in modern American history, the bus boycott, as related by Gunnar Jahn in his presenting address in celebration of the laureate. The King family had lived in Montgomery for less than a year when the highly segregated city became the epicenter of the growing struggle for civil rights in the United States, sparked by the historic Brown v. 1954 Board of Education.
        On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), refused to give her seat to a white passenger on a bus from Montgomery and was arrested. Activists coordinated a bus boycott that was supposed to last 381 days. The Montgomery bus boycott placed a heavy financial burden on the public transportation system and downtown business owners. They elected Martin Luther King Jr. as the leader and official spokesperson for the protest.
        When the Supreme Court ruled the unconstitutional provision of separate seats on public buses in November 1956, King, heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and activist Bayard Rustin, had risen to the national spotlight as an inspiring defender of the resistance, organized and non-violent. The boycott was in effect for 382 days. Negroes and whites traveled together on December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States deemed the statutes requiring segregation on buses unconstitutional. Buses were shared equally by blacks and whites.
      </p>
      <p id="tribute-info">During the boycott, King was detained, his home was bombed, and he was exposed to personal abuse, but he also emerged as a top-ranking Negro leader. In 1957, he was chosen president of the Southern Christian Direction Conference, a group founded to provide new leadership to the civil rights movement, which was then in its infancy. He drew inspiration for this organization from Christianity and Gandhi's operational skills. King traveled nearly six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times between 1957 and 1968, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action. During these years, he organized a major protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that drew worldwide notice, forming what he called a "coalition of conscience."
      </p>
      <p id="tribute-info">In 1960, King and his family moved to his hometown Atlanta, where he joined his father as a co-patron of Ebenezer Baptist Church. This new position did not prevent King and his SCLC colleagues from becoming key players in many of the major civil rights struggles of the 1960s.
        Their philosophy of nonviolence was particularly tested during the Campaign for Birmingham in 1963, when activists boycotted, sat down and marched against segregation, unfair hiring practices and other injustices in one of America's most racially divided cities.
        Arrested for his involvement on April 12, King drafted the civil rights manifesto known as the Letter from Birmingham Jail, an eloquent defense of civil disobedience to a group of white clergy who criticized his tactics. </p>
      <p id="tribute-info">
        Later that year, Martin Luther King Jr. worked with a number of religious and civil rights groups to organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a peaceful political demonstration aimed at shedding light on the injustices suffered by blacks. Americans who continued to be exposed. to land around the world.
        The event, which took place on August 28 and was attended by approximately 200,000 to 300,000 attendees, is widely regarded as a turning point in the history of the American civil rights movement and a factor in the passage of the Act. of Civil Rights of 1964. He directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his address, "I Have a Dream," he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
        <p id="tribute-info">He was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded five holocaust medals; was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and he became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks, but also a world figure.
        At the age of 35, Martin Luther King Jr. became the youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. When informed of his selection, he announced that he would use the $ 54,123 prize money to promote the civil rights movement.
        He was killed on the night of April 4, 1968, standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was supposed to lead a protest march in solidarity with the city's striking garbage collectors.

      <p> "Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow. I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”

Alberta, who played the organ at Ebenezer Baptist Church on Sundays, was closer to the perpetrator, so he chose to shoot her instead. The guy was found guilty and sentenced to death, but his sentence was eventually commuted to life in prison, largely due to King's family's opposition to capital punishment.</p>
      <li id="bold-fact">King is the only non-president to have a national holiday in his name</li>
      <p id="more-info">In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a measure designating Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. He is the only non-president to earn such a distinction; George Washington is the only other American to have a holiday named after him. The holiday was originally observed in 1986 on the third Monday in January, just before Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on January 15. In addition, he is the first non-president to have a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC.</p>
      <li id="bold-fact"> King’s last public speech foretold his death.</li>
      <p id="more-info">King had arrived in Memphis in April 1968 to assist the city's Black trash workers on strike, and he told an audience at Mason Temple Church the night before his assassination, "Like everyone, I would like to live a long life." Longevity has a place in the world. But that's no longer an issue for me... The Promised Land has been glimpsed by me. It's possible that I won't be able to accompany you. But I want you to know tonight that we shall reach the Promised Land as a people. And I'm in a good mood tonight. I am unconcerned about anything. I have no fear of men. My eyes have seen the splendor of the Lord's coming.” </p>
        <li id="bold-fact">King was imprisoned nearly 30 times and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt a decade before his death.</li>
        <p id="more-info">According to the King Center, Martin Luther King Jr. was imprisoned 29 times. He was arrested for acts of civil disobedience and fabricated charges. He was nearly assasinated when King was signing copies of his new book, "Stride Toward Freedom," in Harlem on September 20, 1958, when Izola Ware Curry approached him. He was questioned if he was Martin Luther King Jr. by the woman. Curry added, "I've been looking for you for five years," and slammed a seven-inch letter opener into his chest after he answered yes. The blade's tip came to rest near King's aorta, necessitating hours of precise emergency surgery. Surgeons told King afterwards that a single sneeze may have perforated his aorta and killed him. In a statement, King affirmed his peaceful values and stated that he had no ill intent toward his mentally ill assailant.</p>
